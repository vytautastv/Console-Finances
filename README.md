# Unit 4 Challenge: Console Finances

## Overview

In this challenge, I will be required to use the concepts learned during week 4 of the bootcamp to complete the required activity - using javascript to calculate several required pieces of financial analysis calculations as outlined in the below acceptance criteria.

The motivation for this project was to take all the key learning in the third week of lessons and put them to use in a real world scenario by building a web tool that shows required data from a provided array that includes P&L information and dates. 

The project was built to consolidate knowledge and usage of Javascript best practices. 

This project solves key problems such as using given data in the form of an array to calculate required information and provide financial analysis.

Key learnings: 

1. Use javascript to carry out financial analysis
2. Concatenate strings and numbers
3. Round numbers to the nearest 100th
4. How to utilise for loops 
5. How to display data following specific format requirements
6. How to upload the code to a Github pages site and use the inspect tool to see how the code works.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Create a new GitHub repo called `Console-Finances`. Then, clone it to your computer.

2. Copy the starter files in your local git repository.

You have been given a dataset composed of arrays with two fields, Date and Profit/Losses.

Your task is to write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset.

* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The average of the **changes** in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
  * You will need to track what the total change in Profit/Losses are from month to month and then find the average.
  * (`Total/(Number of months - 1)`)

* The greatest increase in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

* The greatest decrease in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

When you open your code in the browser your resulting analysis should look similar to the following:

  ```text
  Financial Analysis 
  ----------------
  Total Months: 86
  Total: $38382578
  Average Change: -2315.12
  Greatest Increase in Profits/Losses: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
  Greatest Decrease in Profits/Losses: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)
  ```
